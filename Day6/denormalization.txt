denormolization
Normalization aims to simplify maximum form of tables that are independently
responsible for each data subject area

denormolizations is the combination of normalized tables into one for 
example coming up with one table that has all the information that is
 frequently accessed
Consequently, target tables not only contains data relevant to it but 
also information from other tables


Advantages of denormalization
->Increased query execution speed
->Writing queries is much easier
->Ability to add aggregate data, which can be used for efficient reporting
->Reduction of number of tables in a relational database

Disadvantages of denormalization
->Increased processing size
->Increased table sizes
->Increased costs of updating tables and inserts
